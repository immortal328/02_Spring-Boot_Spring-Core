Spring Container:
	- Special type spring object which help us to configure spring setup.
	
	Primary functions are:
		1. Inversion Of Control (IoC) - Creating and management of Object.
		2. Dependency Injection - Inject Object Dependencies.
		
Dependency Injection:
	1. Constructor Injection: - for requaired dependecies
	2. Setter Injection: - for optional dependencies
	3. Field Injection: - define private variable and just give @Autowired on top of it.
	
@SpringBootApplication is combination of:
	- @ComponentScan -> enable component scanning for current packages and recursively scan sub-packages
	- @Configuration -> Able to register extra beans with @Bean / import other configuration classess
	- @EnableAutoConfiguration -> Enable Spring Boot auto configuration support.
	
	SpringApplication.run() -> create application Context and register all beans & start tomcat server	
	
@ComponentScan
	- Start by default scanning component from base package , means from main method package
	- After that recursively scan sub-packages
	
	To scan package outside base package;
		@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages={"com.root.immortal",
												 "com.bus"}
								)			
Qualifiers:
	- If we have multiple classes which implements single interface that time @Qualifier("qualifierName") annotation is useful
	  to let know spring which Bean need to inject.
	  
@Primary:
	When we have multiple classes which implements single interface then we can only one as @Primary 
	
Lazy Initilization:
	@Lazy:
		- It will only Initilize When it needed or Explicitly initilize
		- fine when we have less classes but cause problem when have larger number of classes
		then its problem ?
	Solution:
		- Global Configuration:
			spring.main.lazy-initialization = true
